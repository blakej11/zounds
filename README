Zounds: Zoo Of UNusual Dynamical Systems

This is a program for visualizing and interacting with complex cellular
automata and other dynamical systems.  It uses the GPU to improve the
performance of the computationally intensive parts of taking a timestep and
manipulating an image.  It can load and save images, initialize the system
from a file or from the camera, dynamically change the parameters of the
system, visualize the system in a few different ways, interact with the
data directly via mouse movement, and filter the data to make smoother
changes between images.

The current version of Zounds implements three different systems:

- Jonathan McCabe's Multi-Scale Turing Patterns ("MSTP")
- My multi-color variant of MSTP, known as Turing clouds
- John Conway's Game of Life

My goal with this implementation was to create something that would perform
as close to real-time as possible on a HD (1920x1080) display, and that
wouldn't require physically touching a computer to interact with.  As a
result, this is written as a desktop app rather than a Web trinket. It
requires effort to get the full effect (see the note at the end of the file
"USAGE"), but the results are worth it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build Zounds, just run "make" in the main directory.  GNU make is assumed.

I don't use fancier build frameworks, because this is a fairly simple C
program with not too many dependencies.  It requires the OpenCL, OpenGL,
and GLUT libraries.  If the OpenCV framework is installed, it can use that
to read images from a camera.  If you need to configure where these
libraries are found, edit Makefile.common.

Each dynamical system is compiled into a separate binary. You can build an
individual binary by running "make" in that system's subdirectory.

I've tested this on MacOS (10.13 and 10.14) and Linux (Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS).
I'd welcome patches to get it to build elsewhere.

More details about how to interact with Zounds are in the file USAGE.
The file IMPLEMENTATION has some description about how it works.
